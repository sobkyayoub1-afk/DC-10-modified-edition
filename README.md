# FlightGear DC-10 Aircraft (Modified)  If you need the Octal450 DC-10 but it doesn't work for you, this is a modified version that should work properly.  This aircraft is based on the Octal450 DC-10 project with fixes applied for better compatibility.  **Note:** This is a community-driven fix, not an official release.
And also know you should not download the code you need to go into release tags and then download file which says DC 10.zip
