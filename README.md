# FlightGear DC-10 Aircraft (Modified)  If you need the Octal450 DC-10 but it doesn't work for you, this is a modified version that should work properly.  This aircraft is based on the Octal450 DC-10 project with fixes applied for better compatibility.  **Note:** This is a community-driven fix, not an official release.
And also know you should not download the code you need to go into release tags and then download file which says DC 10.zip and you're gonna have to create a custom FlightGear aircraft directory here are instructions on how to do that find the directory that you want to place your custom director and create a folder name it whatever you want go inside a FlightGear go to add-on and then find aircraft click add folder and then choose the folder that you created then download the patched version and place it and extracted and place it inside you know The folder that you chose in FlightGear and then choose the aircraft from your flight aircraft menu and you're ready to go
So that's just you know, great
