DC-10 Modified Edition

FlightGear DC-10 Aircraft (Modified)

This is a modified version of the Octal450 DC-10 aircraft for FlightGear. If the original Octal450 DC-10 doesn’t work for you, this version includes fixes for better compatibility. Note: This is a community-driven fix, not an official release.

Quick Start

Download the latest DC-10.zip from the Release tags.

Create a custom folder for aircraft anywhere on your system.

Open the FlightGear application, go to Add-ons → Aircraft, and select your custom folder (do not select any aircraft inside, just the root folder).

Place the extracted DC-10.zip contents inside your custom folder.

Open FlightGear, select the DC-10 from the Aircraft menu, and fly!

Note: This patch includes the full DC-10 aircraft—no original aircraft download is needed.
Tip: Use FlightGear 2020.1.3 or higher for full compatibility.
